								<h3>Litter in post box <span>Posted: 13th June 2024</span></h3>
								<p> The village postman caught the chairperson this afternoon and mentioned problems with people putting crisp packets other rubbish and grass cuttings in the post box by Head to Toe. He has had to report this to his manager. He is concerned that if this continues that the post box will be taken out of service which would be awful for everyone who uses it. He mentioned that the post office cannot put any thing on the post box. So please can we all keep an eye out and if any children are hanging about that area.</p>
