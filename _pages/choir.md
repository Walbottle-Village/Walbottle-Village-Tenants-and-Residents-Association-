					<h1 class="mb-4 text-primary">Introducing the Walbottle Village Voices Community Choir!</h1>

<p>Over three years ago, a small group of just six passionate singers came together to form what is now a thriving and welcoming choir in Walbottle Village. Since then, we've grown into a lively group of around 20 members from across West Newcastle, gathering each week to share our love of music.</p>

<p>Less of a choir and more a posh karaoke that sings their hearts out with like-minded, friendly people. We’ve become much more than just a choir — we’ve become a community, a circle of friends brought together by the joy of singing.</p>

<p>With that spirit in mind, we’ve chosen a new name that better reflects who we are today. So from <strong>6th October</strong>, we’ll proudly be known as the <strong>Walbottle Village Voices Community Choir</strong>.</p>

<p>We want to continue to grow, so pop in and discover us now. We look forward to singing — and growing — together!</p>
