						<p>I have lived in walbottle village since 1989 moving into my grandparents family home, Bank Top House. This house and small holding has family history going back to 1890 when the house was built by the Duke of Northumberland to replace a cottage on the site.</p>
						<p>As a child I spent most weekends staying with my grandparents Stella and Bob Mitchison helping out with the pigs on the small holding as well as visiting my Aunt Elsie Graham who lived on Percy Way. She worked for many years in the village post office both before and after the redevelopment of the village in the 1960s.</p>
						<p>My Husband Nick and I really enjoy living in the village and I hope I can continue the great work previously done by Kim Rosie and Shirley.</p>

								<h4><strong>Association Treasurer:</strong> <br>Roger</h4>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>Hello, I’m Roger, Treasurer of the Walbottle Village Tenants and Residents Association. Originally from Derby, I moved North to Newcastle in 1988 and have lived in Walbottle Village since 1991. My profession was in Marine Engineering and I worked for the MoD Navy Department for 43 years until retirement in 2016. I am married to Shirley and have two children and three grandchildren.</p>
						<p>Walbottle Village is a wonderful place to live so when Rosie and Kim suggested setting up a Residents Association I wanted to assist in their project in whatever way I could. The village won the Britain in Bloom (urban community) award in 1990 and it would be great if we could work toward another submission, even better if we won.</p>
						<p>I look forward to meeting as many of my fellow residents as possible and helping to enhance the village for the enjoyment of all.</p>

								<h4><strong>Association Secretary:</strong> <br>Helen</h4>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>Hello everyone. My name is Helen, and I’ve lived in Walbottle since 2014. I’m originally from Kendal, in the South Lakes, but came up to Newcastle for university in 2007 and never left! As a family we love the outdoors; tramping through the Dene, walking in the hills, and digging on our allotment.</p>
						<p>I am also the secretary for Newburn Parish PCC, their Eco-Champion and I have an active role in the Parish Events Group. As the new secretary for the WVTRA I hope to bring my organisational skills to the table, while also thinking with my Eco Hat on to ensure everything we do protects and enhances our beautiful village environment.</p>

								<h4><strong>Association I.T. Support:</strong> <br>Peter</h4>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>I’m Peter, originally from Newcastle and moved to Walbottle at the age of two. First moving to village farm, I soon learned that steps and wheelchairs don’t mix! This prompted a move to a more wheelchair-friendly house on The Paddock and I have recently moved into Forge Walk.</p>
						<p>I’m never too far from a computer and often spend hours tinkering with code. In addition to this, I wear the hat of a Facebook group admin. Despite the role, I don’t delete posts left and right — I’m all about approachability. If you’re blaming someone when the village website breaks, don’t point fingers at me (although you probably should)!</p>
						<p>Oh, and let’s not forget my odd sense of humour. I’m that guy who finds laughter in the weirdest places. So, whether it’s a chat about tech or a quick laugh, I’m your guy!</p>

							<h4><strong>Association Communications Officer:</strong> <br>Chris</h4>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>I've lived in the village for over twenty years and recently volunteered for the role of Communications Officer.</p>
					<p>I work as a freelance graphic designer producing design and artwork for print and developing websites and
						digital projects.</p>
					<p>I've been working with Peter to redesign and develop the WVT&amp;RA website and I'm working on the printed newsletter and social media posts to help promote village events with a view to maintaining consistency and a strong identity for the association.</p>
					<p>Myself and Peter welcome any feedback regarding the website and newsletter and would love to hear from you. We would also like to encourage residents to contact the WVT&amp;RA with their stories, articles or news about Walbottle Village life, past and present, which we can share with the community in our newsletter and on this website.</p>
